# Topology loader 

This is a topology loader orignally developed by Chromik. <br>
I (Verena Menzel) use this loader in the testbed to load different configuration files but do not use the GUI. All unnecessary files for this thesis (including the GUI for specific loadings which is not compatible with my test scenario) for my thesis were removed to prevent further confusion.
